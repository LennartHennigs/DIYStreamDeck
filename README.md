## Features

- Assign actions and colors to the keypad keys
- Actions can be...
  - keyboard shortcuts
  - open a folder (= a new page of key definitions)
- There is a Mac script called `watchdog.py` to enable more capabilities...
  - Determine the active application, to load and show app-specific shortcuts
  - Launch a Mac application
  - Launch a plugin command
- Plugins are included for...
  - Audio playback (to act as a sound board)
  - Spotify playback
  - Philips Hue control
- All key definitions are defined in a JSON file, stored on the Pi Pico
- Define global shortcuts in a `_default` section for both, folders and apps
- Use the  `_otherwise` section to assign shortcuts for non-defined apps (with `watchdog.py` running on a Mac)
- Rotate the keyboard layout clockwise or counter-clockwise (for 3d printed cases) üÜï
- Create your own plugin with the simple plugins system

### Notes

This is an ongoing project. To see the latest changes please take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/DIYStreamDeck/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

It is (still)) a very successful experiment in programming with ChatGPT-4 and Copilot. ü§ñ I built this without any knowledge of Python or CircuitPython. The goal was to not program it myself but tell ChatGPT-4 what I wanted. This is the result so far. GPT wrote the code and this README as well. This paragraph here is the only piece I am writing myself (and about twenty lines in the CircuitPython code).

**Update**: I recently started to refactor some code myself now but still use GPT for new features

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Pimoroni RGB Keypad for Raspberry Pi Pico
- Micro-USB cable to connect the Pi Pico to your computer
- (optional: a Mac for the Watchdog script)

## How it Works

The [`code.py`](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/DIYStreamDeck/blob/main/src/pi_pico/code.py) script reads key definitions from a JSON file and maps them to specific key sequences and LED colors. It listens for the currently active application on the host computer and updates the keypad based on the key mappings for the active application.

The [`watchdog.py`](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/DIYStreamDeck/blob/main/src/mac/watchdog.py) script monitors the currently active application on the host computer and sends its name to the microcontroller connected to the RGB keypad. It also receives `action` commands for plugin events. You can use the pad it without, but then you lose the application-specific launch feature. It is currently only available for a Mac.

## Getting Started

- On the Pi Pico
  - Install CircuitPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico following the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython).
  - Install the required CircuitPython libraries by following the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/circuitpython-libraries).
  - Add the [rgbkeypad-circuitpython](https://github.com/AngainorDev/rgbkeypad-circuitpython) library to your `lib` folder
  - Clone this repository and copy the contents of the `src/pico` folder to your Raspberry Pi Pico.
  
- On the Mac
  - Copy the content of `src/mac` and its sub folders to your Mac
  - Install [Python3 on your Mac](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-version-on-mac-update/), e.g. [via `brew`](https://brew.sh/)
  - If you want to use the plugins, edit the config files in the `config` directory

- Defining keyboard layout
  - Edit the [`key_def.json`](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/DIYStreamDeck/blob/main/src/pi_pico/key_def.json) file to configure the shortcut keys and colors for your desired apps.

## Configuration

In the [`key_def.json`](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/DIYStreamDeck/blob/main/src/pi_pico/key_def.json) configuration file, each app is defined as a JSON object with key-value pairs, with three possible entries: `applications`, `folders`, and `urls`.

- In the `applications` area the different keys for various apps are defined with the key numbers (`0`-`15`).
- The `folders` section defines key sets that can be assigned to a single key.
- The `urls` section contains keyboard definitions for Safari and Chrome URls.

These are the possible fields for a key entry:

- `key_sequence`: This field specifies the key combination to be executed when the key is pressed. You can use either a string or an array [to specify the key sequence](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/hid/en/latest/_modules/adafruit_hid/keycode.html). If a string is provided, it should contain the keycodes separated by '+' (e.g., `CTRL+ALT+T`). If an array is provided, it should contain the keycodes as separate elements (e.g., `["CTRL", "ALT", "T"]`). You can also add delays between key presses within a shortcut by including a floating-point number in the list of keys for a specific shortcut in the `key_def.json` file. This number represents the delay in seconds between key presses. You can find a list of possible keycodes here.
- `application`: This field is used to specify the application to be launched when an application key is pressed.
- `action`: This field can have the values `close_folder` or an plugin command, e.g. `spotify.next`. The former is mandatory inside a folder definition without an `autoclose` setting.
- `color`: This field specifies the color of the key, in RGB format. You can specify the color of the key using an RGB string (e.g., `#FF0000` for red, `#00FF00` for green, `#0000FF` for blue).
- `description`: This optional field provides a description of the function of the key, which is useful for understanding the purpose of each key when printed in the console.
- `folder`: This field allows you assign a folder (a set of key definitions) to be opened. A folder will auto-close per default, ohter actions has been triggered inside. Folders can also be nested.
- `alias_off`: This field will tell the keypad to use another applications key definition. All other keys will be ignored. üÜï
With these fields you can define four types of keys, shortcut keys, application launch keys, and folder keys.

- *Shortcut keys* have a `key_sequence` field which specifies the key combination to be executed when the key is pressed.
- *Application keys* have an `application` field which opens or brings the specified application to front when the key is pressed.
- *Action Keys* have an `action` key. They are used to trigger event of plugins or are needed to provide a `close_folder` action for folders
- *Folder keys*  have an `folder` key. When the key is pressed it will "open" the folder and display its key definitions.  
  
In addition, two more keys are relevant for folders and applications:

- `ignore_default": "true"` will don't ignore the global definitions and don't add them to a folder or an application.
- `"autoclose": "false"` will keep a folder active after a key has been pressed. üÜï

Here is an example configuration file:

``` json
{
  "settings": {
    "rotate": "CCW"
  },

"applications": {
      "_default": {
      "15": {
        "key_sequence": "GUI+Q",
        "color": "#FF0000",
        "description": "Close App"
      }
    },

    "zoom.us": {
      "0": {
        "key_sequence": [
          "GUI+SHIFT+A"
        ],
        "color": "#FFFF00",
        "description": "Mute/Unmute Audio"
      },
      "1": {
        "key_sequence": [
          "GUI+SHIFT+V"
        ],
        "color": "#FFFF00",
        "description": "Start/Stop Video"
      },
      "15": {
        "key_sequence": [
          "GUI+W",
          0.1,
          "RETURN"
        ],
        "color": "#FF0000",
        "description": "End Meeting"
      }
    },

    "_otherwise": {
      "0": {
        "key_sequence": [
          "GUI+SPACE"
        ],
        "color": "#FFFFFF",
        "description": "Open Spotlight Search"
      },
      "4": {
        "action": "spotify.prev",
        "color": "#00FF00",
        "description": "Spotify - Previous Song"
      },
      "5": {
        "action": "spotify.playpause",
        "color": "#00FF00",
        "description": "Spotify - Play or Pause"
      },
      "6": {
        "action": "spotify.next",
        "color": "#00FF00",
        "description": "Spotify - Next Song"
      },
      "13": {
        "folder": "apps",
        "color": "#FFFFFF",
        "description": "Apps Folder"
      }
    }
  },

  "folders": {
    "apps": {
      "0": {
        "action": "close_folder",
        "color": "#FFFFFF",
        "description": "Close"
      },
      "12": {
        "application": "zoom.us",
        "color": "#0000FF",
        "description": "Launch Zoom"
      },
      "13": {
        "application": "Slack",
        "color": "#FF0000",
        "description": "Launch Slack"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the [`key_def.json`](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/DIYStreamDeck/blob/main/src/pi_pico/key_def.json) file, you will find a special app key called `_otherwise`. This key is used to define shortcut keys that are not specific to any particular app. When the Python script is running, it constantly monitors the active application on your computer, and if the active application matches any of the keys in the JSON file, it will load the relevant shortcut keys onto the keypad. If the active application does not match any of the defined keys, the `_otherwise` key is used as a fallback, and the shortcut keys defined under this key are loaded onto the keypad. This means that you can define a set of general-purpose shortcut keys that are always available, regardless of which application is currently active.

In addition you can define a `_default` application. These key definitions will be added to all apps and folders. They can be "overwritten" via specific folder or app definition. You can set `"ignore_default": "true"` for folders and apps where they should not be used.

## Settings

The `key_def.json` File can  also contain a `settings` section. There you can define the `rotate` parameter (`CW` or `CCW` ‚Äì clockwise or counter-clockwise). This will rotate the keyboard layout. This is useful when using the keypad in some 3D printed cases. üÜï

## Plugins

You can build your own plugins for the keypad. They are stored in the `plugins/` folder. A plugin defines set of commands that can be used in the `action` key in the JSON config. In the JSON above you can see three commands being called in the `_otherwise` section. If needed, the plugin can have a config file to load settings.

### Spotify Plugin

As an example I included a Spotify plugin called [spotify.py](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/DIYStreamDeck/blob/main/src/mac/plugins/spotify.py).
The Spotify plugin has the following commands:

- `spotify.play`
- `spotify.pause`
- `spotify.playpause`
- `spotify.next`
- `spotify.prev`
- `spotify.volume_up`
- `spotify.volume_down`

To use it you need to have a Spotify premium account and need to add you API credentials to the [spotify.json](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/DIYStreamDeck/blob/main/src/mac/plugins/config/spotify.json) config file.

### Hue Plugin

- `hue.turn_off [Lamp ID | 'Lamp Name']`
- `hue.turn_on [Lamp ID | 'Lamp Name']`
- `hue.turn_toggle [Lamp ID | 'Lamp Name']`

You need to define the IP address of your hue bridge in the config JSON and press its connect button on first run. Provide the ID of your lamp or its name enclosed in single quotes.

### Audio Playback Plugin

- `sounds.play ['File Name']`
- `sounds.stop`

The plugin can playback `.wav` and `.mp3` files.

## Mac Watchdog Script

To enable the dynamic detection of the active app, you need to run the watchdog script on your computer that sends the active app's name to the Pi Pico via USB serial. This project includes a Python watchdog script **for Mac OS**.

To run the watchdog script, navigate to the directory containing the `watchdog.py` file and execute the following command, e.g.:

``` bash
python3 watchdog.py --port /dev/cu.usbmodem2101 --speed 9600 --verbose
```

- The `--port` parameter needs to be set to the USB serial port corresponding to your Raspberry Pi Pico (e.g., `/dev/cu.usbmodem2101`).
- The optional `--speed` parameter should be set to the desired baud rate for the serial communication (default: `9600`).
- If the optional `--verbose` parameter is set, the current app will be printed to the console.
- With the optional `--rotate` parameter you can rotate the keypad layout clockwise (`CW`) or counter-clockwise (`CCW`). üÜï

When the watchdog script detects a change in the active app, it sends the app's name as a single line over the USB serial connection. The Pi Pico then reads this information, loads the corresponding shortcuts from the `key_def.json` file, and updates the keypad accordingly.

## 3D Printed Case

- As you can see in the picture above I use [a 3d printed case](https://www.printables.com/model/80088-pimoroni-keypad-case/). You can get it [here](https://www.printables.com/model/80088-pimoroni-keypad-case/).
- Since the case rotates the keypad, I added a `settings` section and a `rotate` option for the keyboard layout.
